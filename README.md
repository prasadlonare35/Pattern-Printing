# Java Pattern Printing 🟩

This repository contains a collection of **Java programs** to print various patterns using loops. These pattern problems are commonly used to improve programming logic and strengthen control structure skills in Java.

## 📖 About This Repo
Pattern printing is a popular topic for beginners to practice **nested loops** and understand flow control in programming. This collection covers a variety of shapes and styles, suitable for interviews and coding practice.

## ✨ What's Inside?

### 1️⃣ Composite Triangle
- Programs to print composite and combined triangle patterns.
- Focus on building patterns that mix increasing and decreasing sequences.

### 2️⃣ Special Patterns
- Creative and non-standard patterns such as diamond shapes, pyramids, or custom symbols.
- Perfect for learning nested loop variations.

### 3️⃣ Square and Rectangle
- Programs to print solid, hollow, and bordered squares or rectangles.
- Useful for practicing grid-based logic.

### 4️⃣ Triangle and Reverse Triangle
- Basic left-aligned and right-aligned triangles.
- Includes reverse patterns (inverted triangles) as well.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Basic understanding of `for` and `while` loops

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasadlonare35/Pattern-Printing.git
   cd Pattern-Printing
2. Compile and run any file:
    ```bash
    javac TriangleStar.java
    java TriangleStar
    
## 🎯 Purpose
These programs are part of my Java learning journey and are great for practicing nested loops and improving logical thinking.

Feel free to use them for your own practice or learning projects! 🚀
